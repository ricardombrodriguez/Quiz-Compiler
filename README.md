# Quiz language

-----

Final project of the *Compilers* course.

## Theme of the project

The main goal of this work is the creation of a programming environment that allows the creation of programs in a generic programming language (Java, C++, Python, ...) that, when executed, can carry out an interactive questionnaire.
This general objective can be broken down into 4 components:

- Definition of the main quiz language that allows building interactive quizzes.
- Construction of the compiler that allows to transform a description in this language into a program in generic language.
- Definition of a secondary language that allows defining question banks.
- Providing the main language with the means to extract questions from question banks.

## Goals of this project

- Conception and definition of a programming language (syntax and semantics).
- Implementation in *ANTLR4* of lexical and syntactical analysis of a compiler for the language;
- Definition of the semantic rules to be applied to a language, and their implementation in the context of the previous point.
- Writing of a document that describes a language (existing instruments and their meaning; examples of programs; etc.).
- Careful choice of a target language, where the syntax (*backend*) of the compiler can be implemented.
- Definition of code generation standards for language instructions.
- Complete Compiler Realization
